# **Chronic Disease Prevalence Analysis**

## Overview
This project analyzes the prevalence of chronic diseases using data-driven techniques. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations in chronic disease occurrence across different demographics, aiding in better public health planning and decision-making.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, removing inconsistencies, and capping outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis of chronic disease prevalence.
- **Visualizations**: Graphical representation of trends, distributions, and correlations.
- **Insights & Recommendations**: Findings that support healthcare policies and preventive strategies.

## Data Sources
The dataset includes demographic and health-related attributes, such as:
- Gender
- Disease prevalence across different regions
- Historical trends in chronic diseases

## Key Findings
- Certain age groups and demographics are at higher risk.
- Lifestyle factors like smoking and obesity strongly correlate with specific diseases.
- Chronic disease prevalence varies significantly across different regions.
- Some diseases show increasing trends over time, requiring urgent intervention.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data analysis and visualization
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Dash & Plotly**: Interactive visualizations

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the analysis notebook or script:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook Chronic_Disease_Analysis.ipynb
   ```
4. View interactive dashboards (if applicable) by running:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

## Conclusion
This analysis provides actionable insights into chronic disease patterns, helping in risk assessment, public health planning, and research. Future work can integrate machine learning models for predictive analysis.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement predictive modeling for early disease detection.
- Integrate real-time data sources.
- Enhance visualizations with geospatial analysis.
